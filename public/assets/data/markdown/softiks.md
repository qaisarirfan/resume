I commenced my professional journey with **Softiks Inc**. where I garnered invaluable experience in the field. My focus was primarily on front-end development, and I executed several projects with great success, delivering them all within the set timelines. During this time, I worked extensively with `HTML` and `CSS`, but I also took the initiative to learn `JavaScript` and `jQuery`. I applied this knowledge by developing mobile sites with `JQuery mobile`, which further broadened my skillset.

As a front-end developer, my responsibilities included creating `CSS` and `CSS3` style sheets, which were compatible across all browsers and platforms, while ensuring the technical feasibility of UI/UX designs. I collaborated closely with my colleagues and stakeholders to meet project requirements and deliver high-quality results.
