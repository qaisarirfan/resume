My time at **Progos Tech** was yet another enriching experience in my career journey. I gained a deep understanding of `WordPress`, `Magento`, and `ReactJS` development, which allowed me to take on a range of tasks with confidence. Notably, I was entrusted with managing a project independently, which provided me with an opportunity to showcase my leadership skills. I delivered the project within the stipulated timeline with minimal errors.

My core responsibilities at **Progos Tech** included front-end development, creating CSS and CSS3 style sheets that were consistent across all browsers and platforms, and developing hybrid mobile and TV apps using JavaScript and JQuery. To ensure responsive design for mobile devices, I utilized the Bootstrap framework.

In addition to this, I also contributed to creating quality mock-ups and prototypes on tight timelines, optimizing web applications for maximum speed and scalability, and building reusable code and libraries for future use in JavaScript and JQuery. To stay ahead of emerging technologies, I remained up-to-date on the latest developments in the field.

My expertise in single-page web apps, JavaScript templating, AJAX request/response, and manipulating data to Markup, among other skills, allowed me to effectively develop new user-facing features and contribute to the success of the projects I worked on.
